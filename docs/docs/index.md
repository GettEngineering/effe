# Effe library

## Motivation

The Effe helps us to write process flows at Gett with the following features:

- Provide visibility and traceability into these process flows
- Errors are wrapped automatically
- Dependencies are built for flow automatically
- Easy flow debugging
- Easy flow extending
- Split dependencies for steps in flow: the step has only dependencies that it needs
- Allow greater reuse of existing functions
- Easy flow testing: small interface/easier to understanding what happening
